# Dynamit Code Standards

Writing code with style. [http://dynamit.github.io/code-standards](http://dynamit.github.io/code-standards)

## Usage

These standards are a baseline for development best practices and style. They help smooth the friction of collaboration. They are not heavy-handed or overly-prescriptive - they strike a nice balance between team-think and autonomy. At Dynamit, we use them as a mostly agreed-upon baseline for development. They help us deliver cohesive, high-quality code.
